Answer 10: No, the changes i made online did not show up on my local copy of README.md

Answer 11: After typing "git push" again, the following error message was displayed:
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/ezeccaj/git-lab.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again. See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
